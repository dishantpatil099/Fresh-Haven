# Project Description: 

   Fresh Haven (FRT Internship Project) uses Azure Static WebApp and Azure Health Bot to solve the growing concern, arising due to un-healthy & non-organic fruits and vegetables.
   
   The project aims to address the growing concern over the hazardous side effects of non-organic and stale vegetables and fruits on human health. The project seeks to connect consumers who are health-conscious and want to have access to fresh organic produce with local farms and farmers.

   The website will serve as a platform where consumers can browse and order fresh vegetables and fruits directly from local farms. It will feature a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily navigate through the available products and make orders.
   
   Azure Health Bot can be a valuable addition to a website that delivers fresh organic farm products to consumers by providing a conversational AI solution that can help with various aspects of customer engagement and support. 

   To ensure the quality and freshness of the produce, the website will feature a rating system where customers can rate the quality of the produce they receive. This will help farmers to improve their farming practices and maintain the high quality of their produce.

   The website will also feature a blog section that will educate consumers on the benefits of organic farming and the dangers of consuming non-organic and stale produce. This will create awareness and educate consumers on the importance of consuming fresh and healthy food.

   The project will be scalable and will allow for the expansion of the network of local farms and farmers as demand for organic produce grows. Overall, the web development project seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of consumers by providing them with access to fresh and healthy organic produce directly from local farms.
